### Client Internals
- Largely a collection of Managers and Drivers used to overcome message loss to and from DataStores.
  - Drivers track response state and re-issue messages to slow/offline stores until the individual operation concludes
  - Managers track the drivers and deliver messages to them as they arrive from the network
- There are two key Managers:
  - ReadManager - Ensures reads complete
  - TransactionManager - Ensures transactions complete
- Proactively assists with object reconstruction by sending OpportunisticRebuild messages when DataStores return stale
  object state.
